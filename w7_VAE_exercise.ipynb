In a usual scenario, we wish to approximate some function $f: X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, from some data set $D = \\{(x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}$, where $x \\in X$ and $y \\in Y$. Typically, we train these networks by minimizing a loss function using mini-batch gradient descent on some loss function $\\mathcal{L}(\\Theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i =1}^n e(NN_\\Theta(x_i), y_i)$. Here, $\\Theta$ is the parameters of the neural network (NN) and $e$ is some error funtion.\n","\n","Let's see a small
